# n8n Official MCP vs n8n-mcp — Head-to-Head Competitive Analysis

**Date:** 2026-07-02 (supersedes the 2026-06-19 edition)
**Official server tested:** live n8n MCP server on a **production instance running the current stable release** (July re-test; npm `latest` is n8n 2.28.4, `@n8n/workflow-sdk` 0.21.2), on top of the June edition's evidence: a then-stable live server (full-rewrite path) and the **n8n 2.27.0 source tree**.
**n8n-mcp version tested:** measurements carried from 2.59.0 (bundles n8n 2.26.2, live staging, 2026-06-19); current release at this edition is 2.61.0 (bundles n8n 2.27.4).

## 0. What changed since the June 2026 edition

The June edition's headline was that the official diff-based `update_workflow` existed only in pre-release source, so the April "n8n-mcp wins iterative editing by 6.5×–22×" finding still held on the stable channel — with a near-term expiry. **That expiry has arrived.** This refresh re-ran the June probes on 2026-07-02 against a production n8n instance running the current stable release:

- **The official diff-based `update_workflow` is shipped and live.** The tool now accepts only `{ workflowId, operations[] }` (12 op types observed; atomic; max 100/call) — the full-SDK-code update path is gone from the schema. A real 4-op "insert one node mid-flow" edit applied cleanly. Note: n8n's docs date partial-update support to v2.20.0, which conflicts with the June live observation of a full-code-only tool on the then-stable channel — most plausibly progressive rollout or flag gating. Either way, current instances have it.
- **Raw per-edit parity for whole-value edits, measured:** the same insert-one-node edit costs **509 chars** on the official server vs **~492 chars** via `n8n_update_partial_workflow` — a tie. The April/June token-multiple claim is **retired for current n8n versions** (it still applies to instances that haven't rolled forward).
- **The surgical-edit advantage survives parity and is now quantified against the shipped diff tool:** a one-line change inside a ~1 KB Code node costs **1,174 chars** officially (`setNodeParameter` resends the whole field; no find/replace, no array indices) vs **220 chars** via `patchNodeField` — **5.3×, scaling linearly with field size**.
- **`validate_node_config` is shipped**, not just in source. It returns precise per-field errors for missing required fields and missing agent subnodes — but silently passes unknown node types, non-existent typeVersions, and **all community nodes** as `valid:true`.
- **The validator-honesty gap persists in full on the current release:** all five June probe workflows still return `valid:true` (three silently, two with non-blocking warnings). An agent loop using `valid:true` as its stop signal still accepts all five broken workflows. n8n-mcp errors on all five.
- **The durable differentiators are unchanged**: templates, community/custom-node coverage, credentials CRUD, instance audit, version history, multi-instance/SaaS, autofix, and surgical in-field edits (`patchNodeField`).

The June strategic correction now stands without an expiry date: **a raw per-edit token multiple is not the moat.** The moat is validation an agent can trust as a stop signal, surgical large-field edits, and ecosystem breadth (templates, community nodes, credentials, audit, versions, multi-instance).

---

## 1. Executive summary

n8n ships a first-party MCP server inside the product (`packages/cli/src/modules/mcp/`), with workflow authoring split into `@n8n/workflow-sdk` and `@n8n/ai-workflow-builder.ee`. The architectural divergence has narrowed: the official server makes the LLM **author** workflows as TypeScript code against a fluent SDK, while its **update** path now uses the same JSON-diff model n8n-mcp pioneered (create remains SDK-code-only).

| Concern | Winner | Margin / Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Greenfield authoring (built-in nodes) | ≈ Tie (different model) | Official: SDK TypeScript → `create_workflow_from_code`. n8n-mcp: direct JSON + 2,700+ templates + NL-to-workflow (hosted). n8n-mcp wins on template-accelerated starts. |
| Iterative editing, raw token cost | ≈ Tie (current versions) | Official diff update shipped and live-verified 2026-07-02: **509 vs ~492 chars** for the same insert-one-node edit. Instances on older versions still see the full-rewrite path and the old 3.5×–20× gap. |
| Surgical large-field / Code-node edits | **n8n-mcp** | `patchNodeField` does find/replace inside a field; the official `setNodeParameter` (RFC 6901 pointer) has no find/replace and no array indices, so it re-sends the whole field value. Measured vs the shipped diff tool: **1,174 vs 220 chars (5.3×)** for a one-line edit in a ~1 KB Code node; ratio scales with field size. |
| Validation depth & actionability | **n8n-mcp** | 4 named profiles + by-ID validation + 13-fix-type autofix. Official: reports-only; **all five broken-config probes still `valid:true`** on the current release (live-verified 2026-07-02). |
| Single-node validation | ≈ Tie (official caught up) | Official `validate_node_config` is shipped with precise per-field errors — but silently passes unknown node types, invalid typeVersions, and all community nodes. |
| Templates / patterns library | **n8n-mcp** | 2,700+ templates; official has zero template tools. |
| Credentials management | **n8n-mcp** | n8n-mcp has CRUD + getSchema; official has read-only `list_credentials` + auto-assign only (HTTP nodes excluded). |
| Instance audit / security scan | **n8n-mcp** | n8n-mcp ships it; official has none. |
| Workflow version history & rollback | **n8n-mcp** | n8n-mcp has it; official has only soft-delete `archive_workflow`. |
| Community-node coverage | **n8n-mcp** | n8n-mcp covers ~1,845 nodes (816 core + 1,029 community). Official can *search* installed community nodes but cannot *type/validate* them (schemas baked to the two built-in packages). |
| Multi-instance / fleet / SaaS | **n8n-mcp** | n8n-mcp ships a multi-tenant SaaS; official is 1:1 to one n8n. |
| Drafts / publish lifecycle | **Official** | `publish_workflow` / `unpublish_workflow`; n8n-mcp uses the activate flag. |
| Project / folder placement on create | **Official** | `create_workflow_from_code` takes `projectId` + `folderId`; n8n-mcp has no folder placement. |
| Pin-data testing | **Official** | `prepare_test_pin_data` + `test_workflow`; n8n-mcp has no pin-data prep surface. |
| Data tables CRUD | ≈ Tie | Official has a 7-tool suite; n8n-mcp has `n8n_manage_datatable` (CRUD + filter + dryRun). |
| Native in-instance integration / no API token (self-host) | **Official** | Runs inside n8n; instance-scoped auth, optional preview UI. n8n-mcp self-host passes an API key (SaaS users do not). |

**Strategic read:** the official MCP is strongest for authoring and iterating on **built-in-node** workflows inside one n8n account, and the iteration-cost gap is now closed on current versions. n8n-mcp is strongest where the work touches the **ecosystem** — templates, community/custom nodes, credentials, audit, version history, fleets — for **surgical edits to large fields**, and wherever an agent needs **validation it can trust as a stop signal**.

## 2. Methodology and reproducibility

This edition rests on four evidence streams — three from the June edition (dated 2026-06-18/19) plus a July re-test:

1. **Live head-to-head.** The official server was exercised directly via its connected MCP tools (`search_nodes`, `get_node_types`, `validate_workflow`, `get_sdk_reference`, `update_workflow` schema, `search_workflows`) against its live n8n instance. n8n-mcp was exercised against its live staging instance (`n8n-test.n8n-mcp.com`). Validator probes and a token-cost build were run on both.
2. **Source analysis.** The n8n monorepo was cloned (sparse: `packages/cli/src/modules/mcp`, `packages/@n8n/workflow-sdk`, `packages/@n8n/ai-workflow-builder.ee`, `packages/@n8n/db`, `packages/@n8n/config`) at master HEAD (`package.json` version **2.27.0**, 2026-06-18). All official-side claims about op types, validation internals, tool registration, and gating are cited to specific files/lines in that tree.
3. **Telemetry context.** The usage-pattern figures in §3.4 are carried forward from the 2026-04-30 telemetry pull and are explicitly dated; they were **not** re-queried for this edition. They are used only to establish that iteration dominates usage — not to project a counterfactual dollar figure against the official server (see §3.4 for why that projection was retired).
4. **July re-test (this edition).** On 2026-07-02 the key probes were re-run against the official MCP server of a **production n8n instance running the current stable release** (instance identity withheld): the `update_workflow` schema plus a live 4-op edit, the five validator probes, `validate_node_config` probes, and payload measurements for the insert-node and Code-node edit shapes. n8n-mcp-side payload numbers are carried from the June staging measurements (v2.59.0); the edit shapes are identical, so the comparison holds.

**A note on version drift.** The June edition's central caveat — the live stable server and the source tree disagreed — is resolved: the diff-based `update_workflow` and `validate_node_config` are live on current instances (§3, §6). What remains is **instance drift**: servers on older n8n versions still expose the full-code update path (one such live server was observed as late as 2026-07-02), while n8n's docs date partial-update support to v2.20.0 — earlier than the June live observation of full-code on the then-stable channel. Treat per-instance MCP capability as a function of that instance's n8n version, not of the docs.

## 3. The update problem: parity shipped, measured

### 3.1 Shipped and live-verified (2026-07-02) — diff-based

On a production instance running the current stable release, `update_workflow` accepts only `{ workflowId, operations[] }`:

- **12 operation types observed live**: `updateNodeParameters, setNodeParameter, addNode, removeNode, renameNode, addConnection, removeConnection, setNodeCredential, setNodePosition, setNodeDisabled, setNodeSettings, setWorkflowMetadata`. (The 2.27.0 source tree's `addTags`/`removeTags` were not registered on the tested instance — registration appears version- or flag-dependent.)
- **Atomic, max 100 ops/call**; first failing op aborts the batch, nothing saved. There is no dry-run (`validateOnly`) and no best-effort (`continueOnError`) mode — always atomic-or-throw.
- **The full-SDK-code update path is gone from the schema.** The asymmetry noted in June shipped as predicted: `create_workflow_from_code` remains SDK-TypeScript-only — the SDK lives on the create path while update moved to JSON ops.
- A real 4-op "insert one node mid-flow" edit (9→10 nodes) applied cleanly and returned `validationWarnings: []`.

Measured payloads for identical edit shapes (official live 2026-07-02 vs n8n-mcp June staging measurements):

| Edit | Official `update_workflow` (diff, live) | n8n-mcp `n8n_update_partial_workflow` |
|---|---|---|
| Insert one node mid-flow (4 ops) | **509 chars** | **~492 chars** |
| One-line change in a ~1 KB Code node | **1,174 chars** (whole `jsCode` resent via `setNodeParameter`) | **220 chars** (`patchNodeField` find/replace) |

Whole-value edits are a statistical tie. The raw per-edit token multiple from the April/June editions is **retired for current n8n versions**. The surviving, growing gap is the surgical-edit shape (§3.3).

### 3.2 The lag tail — where the old gap still applies

Instances that have not rolled forward still expose the full-code `update_workflow` (`{ workflowId, code }`) — one such live server was still observed on 2026-07-02. For those, the June measurements stand: a full program resend per edit (1,715 chars to add one node to a 9-node workflow, where the change itself is 154 chars), scaling with workflow size against n8n-mcp's flat ~550-char diffs:

| Workflow size | n8n-mcp CREATE (JSON) | n8n-mcp partial-update (ops) |
|---|---|---|
| 4 nodes | 1,320 chars | 561 chars |
| 15 nodes | 5,295 chars | 556 chars |
| 30 nodes | 10,795 chars | 550 chars |

That puts the per-edit ratio on pre-diff instances at ~3.5× (9 nodes) climbing toward ~20× (30 nodes). n8n's docs date partial-update support to v2.20.0, which conflicts with the June live observation of full-code on the then-stable channel; the likeliest explanation is progressive rollout or flag gating. Practical read: **the gap is now a property of the instance's version, and it shrinks to zero as the fleet upgrades.**

### 3.3 The advantage that survives parity: surgical in-field edits

n8n-mcp's `patchNodeField` does **string find/replace inside a single field** (`patches: [{find, replace, replaceAll?, regex?}]` on a dot path like `parameters.jsCode`; `src/services/workflow-diff-engine.ts:1009-1013`). Changing one line of a large Code node sends only the changed snippet — measured at **151 chars** for a `version: '1.0'` → `'2.0'` edit on staging.

The official `setNodeParameter` is an RFC 6901 JSON Pointer set: it writes the **entire value** at the pointer and explicitly **does not support array indices** — the shipped tool's own schema says *"Array indices are NOT supported — to change a value inside an array, set the whole array."* There is no find/replace anywhere in the official op set. **Measured against the shipped diff tool (2026-07-02):** a one-line edit inside a 999-char `jsCode` cost **1,174 chars** officially (full-field resend) vs **220 chars** via `patchNodeField` — **5.3×**, and because the official cost tracks field size while the patch cost is constant, the ratio grows linearly (a 10 KB Code node → ~50×).

n8n-mcp also carries **19 ops vs 12 observed live** (14 in the 2.27.0 source tree), plus `validateOnly` (dry-run) and `continueOnError` modes the official tool lacks (it is always atomic-or-throw). Notable additional capabilities vs the official op set include `patchNodeField`, `rewireConnection`, `cleanStaleConnections`, and `replaceConnections` (plus `validateOnly`/best-effort modes).

### 3.4 Why iteration matters (usage context, 2026-04-30 telemetry — not re-queried)

*The figures below are dated 2026-04-30 and are carried forward unchanged; they establish that iteration dominates real usage. They are aggregate and anonymized per the [privacy policy](../PRIVACY.md).*

- **6.21:1 update-to-create ratio** across 84,034 users in 90 days — iteration, not greenfield authoring, is the dominant pattern.
- **89.2% of update calls** go through the diff-based partial tool when users have the choice.
- Real workflow sizes cluster where diffs matter: **mean 23.4 nodes**, p90 51, p99 123.

**Retired claim.** The April edition projected ~$601k/quarter in avoided output-token cost versus the official server, on the premise that the official path always full-rewrites. That premise has now expired (§3.1), so the headline dollar projection stays withdrawn. The defensible residual cost argument is narrower: (a) it holds only for **instances still on pre-diff n8n versions** (§3.2), and (b) it persists indefinitely for **large-field / Code-node / array edits** via `patchNodeField` (measured 5.3× at ~1 KB, scaling with field size). Anyone re-running the cost analysis should scope it to those two cases and re-query telemetry rather than reuse the old figure.

---

## 4. Architecture & transport (official, 2.27.0 source)

- **Location:** `packages/cli/src/modules/mcp/` (mounted on the `main` instance).
- **Endpoint:** `/mcp-server/http` with HEAD/GET/POST (`mcp.controller.ts:29,77,110`).
- **Transport:** stateless Streamable HTTP — a fresh `McpServer` + transport per request (`sessionIdGenerator: undefined`, `mcp.controller.ts:200-206`).
- **Auth:** Bearer token routed by a JWT `meta.isOAuth` flag to either OAuth access-token verification or MCP API-key verification (`mcp-server-middleware.service.ts:39-60`). HEAD returns `401` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer` for discovery. CORS is wide-open (`*`).
- **Server identity:** name `n8n MCP Server`, version bumps to **1.1.0** when the builder is enabled (`mcp.service.ts:204-213`).
- **Resources:** one MCP resource, `n8n://workflow-sdk/reference` (builder path only). When `N8N_MCP_APPS_ENABLED` (default false) is on, a workflow-preview MCP-App iframe is attached to `create_workflow_from_code` (`mcp.service.ts:475-500,554-571`).

n8n-mcp by contrast ships a standalone MCP server (stdio + single-session HTTP with persistent session state) plus a multi-tenant SaaS (OAuth2/Auth0, AES-256-GCM-encrypted per-instance credentials so users never expose their n8n API key to the AI client).

---

## 5. The TypeScript Workflow SDK

The SDK is the codegen engine behind the official create path. It matured from 0.12.x to 0.20.0 over ~9 roughly-weekly minors (npm `time` object: 0.12.0=2026-04-28 … 0.19.2=2026-06-15, 0.20.0=2026-06-16); as of 2026-07-02, npm `latest` is **0.21.2** — the weekly cadence continues.

- **Authoring (unchanged in spirit):** the LLM writes `workflow('id','name').add(trigger).to(node...)` with `node()/trigger()/ifElse()/switchCase()/merge()/splitInBatches()` and AI subnode binding by reference (`subnodes: { model, tools, memory, outputParser }`). Type-checked authoring for built-in nodes via `get_node_types` (real `.d.ts`); auto-layout via `@dagrejs/dagre`.
- **What's new:** full **bidirectional round-trip codegen** (`json-to-code` and `code-to-json` CLIs with dedicated roundtrip test suites) and composite control-flow handlers (if-else, switch-case, splitInBatches/merge). Round-trip is the mechanism behind "update existing workflows" — and behind the 2.27.x move of update onto JSON ops.
- **What it still gives up:** community-node typing (SDK type generation reads only `nodes-base` and `@n8n/nodes-langchain`, `generate-types.ts:6-8,40-44`); and the AST-interpreter foot-guns remain (reserved JS identifiers like `fetch` rejected as "Security violation").

---

## 6. Validation

### 6.1 Live probes against the stable official validator

Five invalid configurations were sent to the official `validate_workflow` and to n8n-mcp's `validate_workflow` (profile `runtime`):

| Probe | Official (live, stable) | n8n-mcp (live) |
|---|---|---|
| Unknown node type (`totallyMadeUpNode`) | **`valid:true`** (silent) | **ERROR** — "Unknown node type … must include the package prefix" |
| `typeVersion: 99` on httpRequest | **`valid:true`** (silent) | **ERROR** — "typeVersion 99 exceeds maximum supported version 4.4" |
| HTTP Request without `url` | **`valid:true`** (silent) | **ERROR** — "Required property 'URL' cannot be empty" |
| Two nodes with the same name | **`valid:true`** (silent) | **ERROR** — "Duplicate node name" |
| AI Agent without language model | **`valid:true`** + 3 warnings (incl. "Required field subnodes is missing") | **ERROR** — `MISSING_LANGUAGE_MODEL` |

Four of five pass silently as `valid:true`; the fifth is `valid:true` with warnings. An agent loop using `valid:true` as its stop signal accepts all five broken workflows as done. n8n-mcp errors on all five.

**July re-run (current stable release, live 2026-07-02):** all five probes **still return `valid:true`**. Three remain fully silent (unknown node type, `typeVersion: 99`, duplicate node names); two now attach non-blocking warnings (HTTP-without-URL → an `INVALID_PARAMETER` warning; AI-Agent-without-LM → 3 warnings including the missing `subnodes`). The June source-tree prediction — Zod schema errors downgraded to warnings "to maintain backwards compatibility" — is confirmed in shipped behavior. The stop-signal failure mode is unchanged: `valid:true` accepts all five broken workflows.

### 6.2 What shipped since June (live-verified 2026-07-02)

- **Single-node validation is live:** `validate_node_config` validates 1–50 candidate node configs in isolation. Probed directly: it returns **precise per-field errors** for a missing required field (`Required field "parameters.url" is missing. Expected string.`) and for an AI Agent missing its model (`Required field "subnodes" is missing`). But it **silently returns `valid:true`** for an unknown node type (`totallyMadeUpNode`), an impossible `typeVersion: 99`, and **any community-node type** — no schema means no validation, exactly the `loadSchema` graceful-fallback hole the June source analysis predicted. For community nodes the official validation surface is a rubber stamp.
- **Structured result:** `validate_workflow` returns `{valid, errors, warnings}`; hard parse failures yield `valid:false`.
- **Expanded taxonomy** (2.27.0 source): ~33 error/warning codes with `violationLevel`; new structural checks (Switch outputs/fallback, Merge `numberInputs`, input/output index validity, invalid `ai_tool` source, placeholder slots). Note: the source tree treats AI-Agent-without-LM as a hard error (`MISSING_REQUIRED_INPUT`), but the live current-release server reports it as a **warning** (§6.1 July re-run) — the softer path is what shipped.
- **Both April findings are now confirmed in shipped behavior:** (1) Zod config errors are downgraded to warnings (source comment: *"Report as WARNING (non-blocking) to maintain backwards compatibility"*) — a broken node config is still `valid:true`. (2) Unknown node types and invalid typeVersions pass silently via the no-schema fallback, at both workflow and single-node level.

### 6.3 n8n-mcp validation edge

- **4 named profiles** (`minimal`, `runtime`, `ai-friendly`, `strict`) vs one un-exposed `strictMode` boolean.
- **By-ID validation** (`n8n_validate_workflow`) and **autofix** (`n8n_autofix_workflow`, 13 fix types) — the official server reports warnings but never repairs.
- **Schema errors are real errors**, not silent warnings; **community nodes are validated** (the official server treats no-schema nodes as `valid:true`).

### 6.4 Where the official validator is genuinely strong

Field-level expression-path validation against upstream `output:` samples and `INVALID_INPUT_INDEX` with concrete fix suggestions remain clever patterns n8n-mcp does not fully replicate; the SDK error messages are high quality and speak the SDK syntax directly.

---

## 7. Tool inventory

The 2.27.0 source tree registers **30 tools** (18 always-on + 12 builder-only, `mcp.service.ts:216-576`). The current-release production server tested 2026-07-02 exposed **28 tools live**, including `validate_node_config`, `list_credentials`, `search_executions`, `get_suggested_nodes` (now registered — June's stable had it defined but unregistered), the 7-tool data-table suite, and `prepare_test_pin_data`; **not** observed on that instance: `explore_node_resources`, `get_workflow_best_practices`, `list_tags` (registration appears version- or flag-dependent). Two other July observations: the server's mandated authoring pipeline got heavier (SDK reference → `get_suggested_nodes` → search → `get_node_types` → per-node `validate_node_config` → `validate_workflow` → create), and `search_nodes` results now carry rich `@builderHint`/`@relatedNodes` guidance metadata — including a first-party **`@n8n/mcp-registry.*` node family** (e.g. `@n8n/mcp-registry.apify`) for agent-optimized MCP integrations.

| Capability | Official | n8n-mcp |
|---|---|---|

| **Update partial** | ✅ shipped (12 ops observed live) | ✅ `n8n_update_partial_workflow` (19 ops) |
| Validate workflow | `validate_workflow` (all 5 broken probes pass as `valid:true`) | `validate_workflow` (4 profiles) + `n8n_validate_workflow` (by ID) |
| Validate single node | `validate_node_config` (shipped; blind to unknown types/versions & community nodes) | `validate_node` |

| Executions | `get_execution`, `search_executions` | `n8n_executions` |
| Pin-data prep | `prepare_test_pin_data` | ❌ |
| **Org / structure** | | |
| Projects / folders | `search_projects` / `search_folders` | projectId only; no folders |
| Data tables | 7 dedicated tools | `n8n_manage_datatable` (CRUD + filter + dryRun) |
| **Operations** | | |
| Health check | ❌ | `n8n_health_check` |
| Templates | ❌ | `search_templates` + `get_template` + `n8n_deploy_template` (2,700+) |

## 8. Workflow management

### 8.1 Drafts/publish, projects/folders, pin-data (official advantages — still hold)

`publish_workflow` / `unpublish_workflow` operate the draft/publish model in `WorkflowEntity`; `create_workflow_from_code` accepts `projectId` + `folderId`; `prepare_test_pin_data` returns JSON Schemas for pin-data so logic nodes run for real while credentialed/external I/O is bypassed. n8n-mcp has none of these surfaces (folder placement is deferred).

### 8.2 Credentials — two trust models (unchanged)

The official server walks each added node's credential slots and auto-assigns the user's first matching credential, **excluding HTTP Request node types for security** (`credentials-auto-assign.ts:19-23`) — live-confirmed 2026-07-02: on create, auto-assign explicitly skipped the workflow's HTTP Request node ("credentials must be configured manually"); `list_credentials` is read-only and never returns secrets. The LLM has no credential CRUD. n8n-mcp takes the opposite approach: full visibility via `n8n_manage_credentials` (list/get/create/update/delete/getSchema), explicit selection between multiple credentials of a type, and HTTP nodes as first-class — appropriate to its standalone-server architecture where the agent operates with the user's API key.

## 10. Empirical artifacts from this analysis

**Live, official server on a production instance, current stable release (2026-07-02; instance identity withheld):**
- `update_workflow` schema = `{ workflowId, operations[] }`, 12 op types, atomic, max 100/call; the full-code path is absent. A 4-op "insert one node mid-flow" edit applied cleanly (9→10 nodes, `validationWarnings: []`).
- Payload measurements: insert-one-node = **509 chars** (vs n8n-mcp ~492, June staging); one-line edit in a 999-char `jsCode` = **1,174 chars** via `setNodeParameter` full-field resend (vs **220 chars** via `patchNodeField` for the identical edit — 5.3×).
- Validator probes (all five still `valid:true`): unknown node type, `typeVersion: 99`, duplicate node names → silent; HTTP-without-URL → + `INVALID_PARAMETER` warning; AI-Agent-without-LM → + 3 warnings.
- `validate_node_config` probes: precise errors for missing `parameters.url` and missing agent `subnodes`; **silent `valid:true`** for `totallyMadeUpNode`, httpRequest `typeVersion: 99`, and a community-node type.
- Credential auto-assign on create skipped the HTTP Request node (security exclusion live-confirmed).
- 28 tools registered, incl. `validate_node_config`, `list_credentials`, `search_executions`, `get_suggested_nodes`; `list_tags` / `explore_node_resources` / `get_workflow_best_practices` absent on this instance.
- Ecosystem observation: `search_nodes` surfaced a first-party `@n8n/mcp-registry.apify` node with agent-targeted builder hints — an MCP-registry node family.

**Live, official server (stable channel, 2026-06-18/19 — previous edition):**
- `update_workflow` tool schema = `{ workflowId, code }` (full SDK code) — full-rewrite confirmed.
- 9-node SDK workflow: validated `{valid:true, nodeCount:9}`; CREATE code 1,561 chars; full resend to add one node = 1,715 chars (change itself 154 chars).
- Validator probes: unknown node, typeVersion 99, HTTP-without-URL, duplicate name → `valid:true` (silent); AI-Agent-without-LM → `valid:true` + 3 warnings.
- Community nodes: `search_nodes(["playwright"])` → "No nodes found"; `get_node_types(["n8n-nodes-playwright.playwright"])` → "not found"; `get_node_types(["n8n-nodes-anchorbrowser.anchorBrowser"])` → "not found" **even though that node is installed** (search surfaced it under "browser automation"). Confirms: official can discover installed community nodes but cannot type/validate them.

**Live, n8n-mcp staging (v2.59.0):**
- `n8n_update_partial_workflow` advertises 19 op types; atomic by default, `continueOnError` + `validateOnly` modes.
- CREATE vs partial-update payloads: 1,320/561 (4 nodes), 5,295/556 (15), 10,795/550 (30).
- 4-edit cumulative on a 15-node workflow: 492 + 151 + 184 + 273 = 1,100 chars / 11 ops; the `patchNodeField` one-line edit was 151 chars.
- Validator probes: all 5 ERROR (`valid:false`) with precise messages.
- Community node: `search_nodes("playwright")` returns the node (community, v0.2.21, 10k npm downloads, full schema).

**Source (n8n 2.27.0 clone, master, 2026-06-18):** diff-based `update_workflow` (14 ops, 100 cap, atomic), `validate_node_config`, 30-tool surface, ~33 validation codes, SDK 0.20.0 round-trip codegen — none yet in a release tag.
